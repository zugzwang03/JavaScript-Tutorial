### JavaScript-Tutorial

Context:
- Variable Object 
- Scope Chain
- this 
    

Function declarations are scanned and made available 

Variable declarations are scanned and made undefined

redux -> js state management library; uses closure

JS considers fn as scope

let is block scoped

var is function scoped

Getters help you get attributes in your class that are private

JavaScript is both functional and procedural, as well as object-oriented. The choice of paradigm depends on how you decide to use it in your application.

JS is a weakly typed language

JS is dynamically typed language

The Decorator Design Pattern is a structural pattern used to dynamically add behavior or responsibilities to an object at runtime without modifying its code.
